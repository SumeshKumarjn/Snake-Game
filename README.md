This Python script implements a classic Snake game using the Tkinter library for GUI. 
Upon execution, a window titled "SNAKE GAME" opens, where the player controls a snake using arrow keys to navigate it across the canvas. 
The objective is to eat randomly generated food items, increasing the snake's length and score. The game ends when the snake collides with the boundaries or itself, prompting a "GAME OVER" message. 
The snake's movement speed, size of game elements, and colors are customizable through defined constants at the beginning of the script.
With its intuitive controls and simple yet engaging gameplay, this Snake game provides an entertaining experience for players of all ages.
